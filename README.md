## 🚀 About the Project

This project is part of **Summer of Code 2025**. The aim was to explore and master the **fundamentals of deep learning** using **PyTorch**, by implementing neural networks from scratch and experimenting with advanced techniques.

I started with **data exploration** and moved step-by-step through building, training, and improving models—culminating in **transfer learning** with pretrained architectures like ResNet‑18. Along the way, I gained both **theoretical foundations** and **practical experience** in model development and evaluation.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

### 📌 1. Understanding the Dataset
- Worked with **Fashion‑MNIST**, a dataset of grayscale clothing images  
- Applied **data preprocessing**: normalization, flattening, reshaping  
- Used **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib** to visualize and inspect patterns

### 📌 2. Neural Network Fundamentals
- Understood **feed-forward neural networks** and the training process  
- Implemented custom **ReLU**, loss functions, and **optimizers**  
- Built training loops using `optimizer.step()` and `loss.backward()`  
- Handled **overfitting** with **dropout layers**  
- Compared **Adam** and **SGD** optimizers for convergence and speed

### 📌 3. Improving Model Performance
- Applied **batch normalization** to stabilize training  
- Used **Xavier (Glorot) initialization** to improve weight distribution  
- Compared model **accuracy** and **loss curves** for performance gains

### 📌 4. Transfer Learning with ResNet‑18
- Understood **transfer learning** and **pretrained models**  
- Modified **ResNet‑18** to accept grayscale input and 10-class output  
- Froze earlier layers and **fine‑tuned** deeper layers  
- Used **confusion matrices** and **accuracy metrics** for final evaluation
