    "## **Fine-tuning a Pretrained ResNet model for Image Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore the concept of transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained ResNet model for the task of image classification. ResNet, or Residual Network, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual recognition tasks. Pretrained models are models that have been previously trained on large datasets, such as ImageNet, and can serve as a starting point for new tasks by leveraging learned features. By fine-tuning the pretrained ResNet, we aim to adapt its feature representations to a new dataset, improving both training efficiency and model performance. This process involves adjusting the model’s final layers to suit the specific classification problem, while retaining the learned features from earlier layers. At the end we compare the prformance of the pre-trained model with that of the fine-tuned model."

It takes in both models, a dataloader, the directory path containing class labels, and the number of images to display.\n",

This ensures that no gradients are calculated during the forward pass, making inference faster and memory-efficient.\n",
